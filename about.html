## About

I am a trained physician interested in the data component of my profession. I like to look at what health professionals do from a broader scope and include not just pahtologies but the concept of health and how to maintain it as the key strategy to medical attention in our time. Since we live in the area of data, it tends to be complicated to evaluate traditional approaches with the amount of data generated and not the same volume of information derived from it (data that makes sense). This blog is a repository of things that converge in the areas of health, data science and technology.

I am currently getting my masters (MSc) degree at the Ensenada campus of Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, México!
