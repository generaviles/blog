## About

I am a trained physician interested in the data component of my profession. I like to look at what health professionals do from a broader scope and include not just pahtologies but the concept of health and how to maintain it as the key strategy to medical attention in our time. Traditional approaches in the evaluation of health intervention and strategies tend to be complicated these days, since we live in the area of big data (a whole bunch of it), the problem gets serious when we can't make sense of the data we have. This blog is a repository of things that converge in these areas.

I am currently getting my masters (MSc) degree at the Ensenada campus of Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, México!
