Cellular Automata (CA) are models that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics"> discrete </a> in time and space, also known as tessellation automata, homogenous strucures, cellular structures, iterative arrays, etc.
Mathematically, they can be defined as a 3-tuple where N is a set containgin the neighborhood values, S is a set containgin the possible states and <i>delta</i> being the transition function.

<p style="text-align:center;"><i>CA={S,N,delta}</i></p>

In the medical world, CA are used to mimic tumor growth, data encriptation, image processing, among others.

It is this last application that caught the attention of a friend of mine and me at a discrete mathematics class here at school. 

We set out to propose a CA with the least amount of rules possible that still could do
